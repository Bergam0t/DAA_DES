# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.

#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.

# Ensure jupyter notebooks are not allowed to be uploaded
# This is in place to minimize the risk of any exploratory data analysis being uploaded, which
# could contain outputs that are not intended for wider sharing if not sanitised correctly.
# If removing this in future, it is highly recommended to look at the addition of a
# notebook stripping GitHub action, which would ensure only the notebook contents, not its output,
# are uploaded. Alternatively, consider doing these kinds of analyses in Quarto or RMarkdown, which
# have many of the same benefits without the same risk of outputs being unexpectedly embedded.
