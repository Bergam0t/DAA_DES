Term,Definition
Discrete Event Simulation,"Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a branch of computer simulation that allows us to explore resourcing and waits in complex systems. <br/><br/>By defining our resources - the helicopters and cars operated by the service - and generating representative calls based on historical data, a computer representation of the system can be generated.<br/><br/> Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a branch of simulation particularly well suited to healthcare systems where we are interested in being able to explore the impact of changes in demand and resourcing - such as additional vehicles or changes to rotas. The name simply refers to how the activities individuals within the simulation undertake - the <b>events</b> - are processed by the computer."
Parameter,"A parameter is one of the things we can change within the model.<br/><br/>The model supports changing a range of parameters, such as the rotas used by vehicles, the model of helicopters operated, and so on."
Run,"A run is a single iteration of the simulation, lasting for the number of days defined in the inputs and using the parameters that have been selected by the user, or the default parameters. One run of the simulation can be thought of a single version of how the future may pan out."
Trial,"A trial referes to two or more - and usually ten or more! - runs of the simulation, which are executed with the same parameters, but with minor variations in areas that can be affected by random chance, such as the precise time between calls requiring HEMS intervention, the proportion of jobs stood down, how long travel time and on scene time is, and so on.<br/><br/>By having multiple runs within a trial, we get to see many versions of how the future may be likely to pan out, giving us a better idea of whether the resourcing and rotas selected will lead to the service being able to meet the demand on it."
