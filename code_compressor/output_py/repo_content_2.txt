| Open licence           | Before sharing code, it’s important to choose an appropriate open-source licence. **A licence tells others how they can use, modify or share your work**.

| Dependency management  | To make sure your code runs correctly for others (or for yourself in the future), you need to list the **required software and versions**. Without this, users may face errors due to missing dependencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | A requirements.txt file is provided at <https://github.com/RichardPilbery/DAA_DES/blob/main/requirements.txt>                                                                                                                                            |

| Open science archive   | To ensure simulation models remain accessible over time, they should be stored in open science archives like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), and the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). These platforms provide **DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers)** for citation and follow principles that guarantee long-term storage and discoverability. Unlike GitHub, which can change or be deleted, archives preserve models permanently. | An Open science archive is currently available here, though note that this currently points towards the fork, not the original repository <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15555520>                                                                      |

| Online Coding Environment | There are tools which enable users to run code online without any installation or downloads. A FOSS example for jupyter notebooks is **BinderHub** ([https://mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)) which creates an online Jupyter environment from a public GitHub or GitLab repository. It packages the code and any dependencies into a container, from which the notebooks can be run. | A devcontainer.json file has been provided in the .devcontainer folder. This enables opening up the development environment in Github Codespaces. To access this, ensure you are logged into GitHub, then look for the green 'Code' button at the top of this repository. Click on this and select 'Create codespace on main'. |

## What is this plot showing?

This chart shows how often helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) were either available and sent or unavailable during each hour of the day. It compares simulated data (used for testing or planning purposes) with historical data (what actually happened in the past).

- The top chart shows the simulated job counts by hour.

- The bottom chart shows the historical job counts by hour.

## What do the colours mean?

Each bar is split into:

- Dark blue: When a HEMS vehicle (either helicopter or car) was available and sent to a job.

- Light blue: When no HEMS was available for a job received during that time period.

If more of the bar is light blue, this means that there were more jobs in that hour that were not responded to by a HEMS resource due to no HEMS resource being available at the time.

## Using this plot for model quality assurance

If the default historical parameters are being used, this plot can be used to judge if the simulation is mirroring reality well.
In this case, we would be looking for two things to be consistent across the top and bottom plots:

- the overall pattern of bar heights per hour (reflecting the total number of jobs being received each hour)
- the split between dark and light blue per hour (reflecting how often a resource is or is not available to respond to a job received in that hour)

This plot shows the split within a callsign group of resources that are sent on jobs.
Bars within a callsign group will sum to 100%.

Dotted lines indicate the average historical allocation seen of resources within a callsign group,
averaged over {len(historical_monthly_totals_df)} months, drawing on data
from {historical_monthly_totals_df.month.min().strftime("%B %Y")}
to {historical_monthly_totals_df.month.max().strftime("%B %Y")}.

If the simulation is using the default parameters, we would expect the dotted lines to be roughly level with the top of the
relevant bars - though being out by a few % is not too unusual due to the natural variation that occurs across
simulation runs.

If the simulation is not using the default parameters, we would not expect the output to match the historical data, but you may
    wish to consider the historical split as part of your decision making.

Historical data has been retrospectively audited to determine when jobs have included interventions that
could only be delivered by an EC or CC team.

This has then been used to inform the rate at which jobs with an EC or CC benefit are generated in the simulation.

While the numbers are low, it does not include a wide range of additional benefits that HEMS crews
bring to the scene. Work is now underway to improve the capture of these additional benefits, but
they are not reflected in the model.

For the model, it has been assumed that the split of CC calls, EC calls and calls where no CC or EC intervention
is delivered is consistent across the day. We do not have access to this data for time where jobs have not historically
been attended due to no resource being in service.

It is also assumed that the split of care categories is consistent across the year.

This data is affected by the fact that the historical actions will be affected by the crew that attended, and reflect
care delivered rather than ideal care. For example, if an EC crew attended a job that would benefit
from a CC intervention (due to no CC crew being on shift or the CC crew already being on another job),
only EC interventions would be delivered and only an EC benefit would have been recorded in the
dataset.

This chart is comparing how long different stages of emergency jobs take in real life (called Historical) versus how long they take in a computer simulation (called Simulated).

The idea is to check if the simulation is realistic by seeing if it behaves similarly to what actually happened in the past.

Each job has several stages:

- Time allocation: Time from when the call was made to when a vehicle was assigned.
- Time mobile: Time from assignment to when the vehicle started moving.
- Time to scene: Travel time to the scene.
- Time on scene: Time spent at the scene.
- Time to hospital: Travel time to the hospital (if applicable).
- Time to clear: Time from hospital drop-off (or leaving the scene, if no patient transport undertaken) to when the vehicle is ready for the next job.

These stages are shown for two types of vehicles:

- Cars (top row) - including both helicopter backup cars and standalone vehicles
- Helicopters (bottom row)

## How to Read the Boxes

- Each blue box shows the range of times for that job stage—how long it usually takes.
- The dark blue boxes are the simulated times, and the light blue ones are the historical (real) times.
- Taller boxes or longer “whiskers” (lines) mean more **variation** in how long that stage takes.
- If the boxes and whiskers for simulated and historical data overlap a lot, that means the simulation is doing a good job of copying reality.

This visual shows the resource use of each resource throughout the simulation.

Grey hatched boxes indicate the time the resource was away for servicing.

- For H70 (g-daas), it is assumed that H71 (g-daan) will be reallocated the callsign H70 during the
service period for g-daas. Therefore, for the H70 line, we would expect calls to continue being allocated
to H70 during its service period, **but we would expect H71 to consequently show no activity in that period.**

- For the servicing of H71 (g-daan), it is assumed that g-daan will be unavailable during that period
and no callsign reallocation will occur, so we would anticipate no activity occurring for H71 during that period.

CC70 and CC71 are backup vehicles, for use in the event that their associated helicopter cannot fly
for any reason (pilot unavailability, servicing, etc.).

It should be the case that resources from the same callsign group (H70 & CC70, H71 & CC71) cannot ever be allocated
to a job at the same time, as it is assumed that a single crew is available for each callsign group.

Unavailability of cars due to servicing is not modelled; cars are assumed to always be available.

*The handles at the bottom of the plot can be used to zoom in to a shorter period of time, allowing
you to more clearly see patterns of resource use. The '1m, 6m, YTD, 1y' buttons at the top of the plot
can also be used to adjust the chosen time period. Double click on the plot or click on the 'reset axes'
button at the top right - which will only appear when hovering over the plot - to reset to looking at
the overall time period.*

This controls how many times the simulation will repeat. On each repeat, while the core parameters
will stay the same, slight randomness will occur in the patterns of arrivals and in choices like which
resource responds, what the outcome of each job is, and more.
\n\n
Think of it like watching 10 different versions of the same day in an emergency control room.
In one run, a call comes in five minutes earlier. In another, a different crew is dispatched.
A patient might recover quickly in one case, or need extra help in another.
\n\n
By running the simulation multiple times, we get a better sense of the range of things that *could*
happen — not just a single outcome, but the full picture of what’s likely and what’s possible.
For example, by running 10 replications of 1 year, we can get a better sense of how well the model
will cope in busier and quieter times, helping to understand the likely range of performance that
might be observed in the real world.

Term,Definition
Discrete Event Simulation,"Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a branch of computer simulation that allows us to explore resourcing and waits in complex systems. <br/><br/>By defining our resources - the helicopters and cars operated by the service - and generating representative calls based on historical data, a computer representation of the system can be generated.<br/><br/> Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a branch of simulation particularly well suited to healthcare systems where we are interested in being able to explore the impact of changes in demand and resourcing - such as additional vehicles or changes to rotas. The name simply refers to how the activities individuals within the simulation undertake - the <b>events</b> - are processed by the computer."
Parameter,"A parameter is one of the things we can change within the model.<br/><br/>The model supports changing a range of parameters, such as the rotas used by vehicles, the model of helicopters operated, and so on."
Run,"A run is a single iteration of the simulation, lasting for the number of days defined in the inputs and using the parameters that have been selected by the user, or the default parameters. One run of the simulation can be thought of a single version of how the future may pan out."
Trial,"A trial referes to two or more - and usually ten or more! - runs of the simulation, which are executed with the same parameters, but with minor variations in areas that can be affected by random chance, such as the precise time between calls requiring HEMS intervention, the proportion of jobs stood down, how long travel time and on scene time is, and so on.<br/><br/>By having multiple runs within a trial, we get to see many versions of how the future may be likely to pan out, giving us a better idea of whether the resourcing and rotas selected will lead to the service being able to meet the demand on it."

# Key Metrics

*All Metrics are averaged across 5 simulation runs*

## Calls Not Attended

Across these runs of the simulation, on average a DAAT Resource was unable to attend 115 of 840 (13.7%) calls

These are the 'missed' calls where no DAAT resource was available. This could be due to no resource being on shift, or all resources being tasked to other jobs at the time of the call.## Missed Jobs


    The simulation estimates that, with the proposed conditions, there would be - on average, per year - roughly

    - **17 critical care** jobs that would be missed due to no resource being available  (***:green[-1]** from historical*), with an estimated range of 12 to 22

    - **33 enhanced care** jobs that would be missed due to no resource being available (***:green[-3]** from historical*) with an estimated range of 27 to 42

    - **299 jobs with no predicted CC or EC intervention** that would be missed due to no resource being available (***:red[+6]** from historical*) with an estimated range of 253 to 336

        - of these missed regular jobs, **51** may have benefitted from the attendance of a helicopter (***:green[-4]** from historical*)
                            ### Historical Missed Jobs


    As CC, EC and helicopter benefit can only be determined for attended jobs, we cannot estimate the ratio for previously missed jobs.
    However, the simulation estimates that, with historical rotas and vehicles, there would be - on average, per year - roughly

    - 18 critical care jobs that would be missed due to no resource being available *(estimated range of 12 to 22)*
    - 36 enhanced care jobs that would be missed due to no resource being available *(estimated range of 27 to 42)*
    - 293 jobs with no predicted CC or EC intervention that would be missed due to no resource being available *(estimated range of 253 to 336)*
        - of these missed regular jobs, 55 may have benefitted from the attendance of a helicopter *(estimated range of 45 to 68)*
                            ## Suboptimal Resource Allocation to Jobs


                The simulation estimates that, with the proposed conditions, there would be - on average, per year - roughly

                - **41 critical care (CC)** jobs that would be sent an enhanced care (EC) resource (***:green[-13]** from historical*), with an estimated range of 27 to 55

                - **69 jobs that would benefit from a helicopter** that would be sent a car (***:red[+4]** from historical*) with an estimated range of 46 to 85
                ## Suboptimal Resource Allocation to Jobs - Historical Comparison


                As CC, EC and helicopter benefit can only be determined for attended jobs, we cannot estimate the ratio for previously missed jobs.
                However, the simulation estimates that, with historical rotas and vehicles, there would be - on average, per year - roughly

                - **54 critical care (CC)** jobs that would be sent an enhanced care (EC) resource, with an estimated range of 46 to 65

                - **66 jobs that would benefit from a helicopter** that would be sent a car, with an estimated range of 55 to 76

Average simulated H71 Utilisation was 13.0%

*The historical average utilisation of H71 was 9.8%*



---



Average simulated CC70 Utilisation was 5.6%

*The historical average utilisation of CC70 was 6.7%*



---



Average simulated CC71 Utilisation was 3.4%

*The historical average utilisation of CC71 was 3.1%*



---



Average simulated CC72 Utilisation was 10.4%

*The historical average utilisation of CC72 was 9.5%*

Without this, users may face errors due to missing dependencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | A requirements.txt file is provided at <https://github.com/RichardPilbery/DAA_DES/blob/main/requirements.txt>                                                                                                                                            |

| Open science archive   | To ensure simulation models remain accessible over time, they should be stored in open science archives like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), and the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). These platforms provide **DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers)** for citation and follow principles that guarantee long-term storage and discoverability. Unlike GitHub, which can change or be deleted, archives preserve models permanently. | An Open science archive is currently available here, though note that this currently points towards the fork, not the original repository <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15555520>                                                                      |

| Online Coding Environment | There are tools which enable users to run code online without any installation or downloads. A FOSS example for jupyter notebooks is **BinderHub** ([https://mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)) which creates an online Jupyter environment from a public GitHub or GitLab repository. It packages the code and any dependencies into a container, from which the notebooks can be run. | A devcontainer.json file has been provided in the .devcontainer folder. This enables opening up the development environment in Github Codespaces. To access this, ensure you are logged into GitHub, then look for the green 'Code' button at the top of this repository. Click on this and select 'Create codespace on main'. |

Testing for the Devon Air Ambulance Discrete Event Simulation (DES) Model.

These check that the results generated by the model when parameters are changed from reality
follow logical rules.

Planned tests are listed below with a [].
Implemented tests are listed below with a [x].

## Additional Helicopters

[x] Adding an additional helicopter results in more calls being answered
[x] Removing a helicopter results in fewer calls being answered

## Additional cars

[x] Adding an additional car results in more calls being answered
[x] Removing a car results in fewer calls being answered

## Adjusting operating hours
