# Important!

`historical_jobs_per_month.csv` does not include **missed** calls - only attended calls are present.

`historical_monthly_totals_all_calls.csv` **does** include missed calls (those that were received but not attended due to no suitable resource being available, whether due to no resources being on shift or all resources being otherwise occupied at the time)
